# Fixed-and-Modular-Naive-Bayes-Health-Condition-Predictor
This project implements a Health Condition Predictor that forecasts diseases based on patient symptoms using machine learning classification algorithms, specifically the Naive Bayes approach. The system leverages a real-world medical dataset containing diseases and their associated symptoms to build a predictive model.
